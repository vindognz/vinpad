# vinpad

stuff to do when i get the actual hardware:

plug into pc via usb while holding the boot button
drag the uf2 file onto the RPI-RP2 drive
(should reboot and mount as CIRCUITPY)

copy code.py and lib onto the root CIRCUITPY drive
(should look like)
CIRCUITPY/
├── code.py
└── lib/
    ├── kmk/
    └── adafruit_hid/

open a text editor and hit all the buttons. it should type 1-6 (spinny thing should mess with volume)
